# Molecular Solubility Prediction

This repository contains my **first machine learning project**, completed by following a tutorial by **Data Professor**.  
The objective is to build regression models that predict the **aqueous solubility of molecules (logS)** using molecular descriptors.

---

## Dataset

The project uses the **Delaney Solubility with Descriptors** dataset, which includes molecular properties such as:
- Molecular Weight
- Number of Rotatable Bonds
- Other physicochemical descriptors

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Splitting**
   - Training set: 80%
   - Test set: 20%

2. **Model Training**
   Two regression models were trained:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   Model performance was evaluated using:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Coefficient of Determination (R²)

---

## Results

The **Random Forest Regressor** achieved better performance on the test set compared to **Linear Regression**.

| Model               | Test MSE | Test R² |
|--------------------|----------|---------|
| Linear Regression  | 1.02     | 0.79    |
| Random Forest      | 0.64     | 0.87    |
